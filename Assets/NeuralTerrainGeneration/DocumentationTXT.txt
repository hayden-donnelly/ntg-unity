Getting started with Neural Terrain Generation:

1. Create a terrain object.
2. Open the terrain tools dropdown from the second tab of the terrain component.
3. Select "Neural Terrain Generation".
4. Set the "Model Asset" field to "pix_diffuser_epoch62" from the NeuralTerrainGeneration/Models folder.
5. Click "Generate Terrain From Scratch".

Neural Terrain Generation UI Guide:

- Model Asset: The NN Model that will be used to generate terrain. It's recommended that you use diffusion1_epoch62.

- Enable Brush: Enables brush to paint freely onto the terrain and shows brush settings.

- Disable Brush: Disables brush and hides brush settings.

- Brush Mask: 256x256 texture that will mask the brush heightmap when painting to create brush shapes other than squares. The brush heightmap will be faded out in proportion to the darkness of the overlapping mask pixels.

- Height Multiplier: Multiplies heights of the terrain when generating from scratch or from existing.

- UpSample Mode: The type of upsampling algorithm that will be used if UpSample Resolution is greate than 256.

- UpSample Resolution: The resolution of terrain when generating from scratch or from existing.

- From Scratch Diffusion Steps: The number of iterations the model will use when generating terrain from scratch. You'll probably want to choose a value between 2 and 20.

- Generate Terrain From Scratch: Generates a new terrain from scratch using the selected model.

- From Selected Diffusion Steps: The number of iterations the model will use when when generating terran from the existing selected terrain.

- From Selected Starting Step: The generation step that the model will start at when generating terrain from the existing selected terrain. A starting step that is close to the total diffusion steps will yield new terrain which is similar to the selected terrain.

- Selected Terrain Weight: The weight of the selected terrain when it is passed into the model to generate a new terrain. Values around the middle of slider yield the best results.

- Generate Terrain From Selected: Generates a new terrain using the selected terrain as a base. This is useful if you want to generate some variations of an existing terrain.

- Blended Function Start Value: The value of the blending function (f(x) = mx + b) at x = 0. 

- Blend With Neighbors: Blends selected terrain with neighbors, ignoring current neighbor heights.
