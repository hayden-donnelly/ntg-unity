- Model Asset: The NN Model that will be used to generate terrain. It's recommended that you use diffusion1_epoch62.

- Enable Brush: Enables brush to paint freely onto the terrain and shows brush settings.

- Disable Brush: Disables brush and hides brush settings.

- Brush Mask: 256x256 texture that will mask the brush heightmap when painting to create brush shapes other than squares. The brush heightmap will be faded out in proportion to the darkness of the overlapping mask pixels.

- Height Multiplier: Multiplies heights of the terrain when generating from scratch or from existing.

- UpSample Mode: The type of upsampling algorithm that will be used if UpSample Resolution is greate than 256.

- UpSample Resolution: The resolution of terrain when generating from scratch or from existing.

- Blended Function Start Value: The value of the blending function (f(x) = mx + b) at x = 0. 

- Blend With Neighbors: Blends selected terrain with neighbors, ignoring current neighbor heights.

Model Asset: The neural network model that will be utilized to generate terrain. We recommend using diffusion1_epoch62. Neural network models are a type of machine learning model that are designed to recognize patterns in data. In this case, the neural network model is trained to generate terrain based on certain input parameters.

Enable Brush: This feature enables the brush tool to paint freely onto the terrain and displays brush settings. The brush tool is used to modify the terrain by painting on it. When enabled, the brush tool can be used to paint on the terrain in real-time, allowing you to see the changes as you make them.

Disable Brush: This feature disables the brush tool and hides brush settings. When disabled, the brush tool cannot be used to modify the terrain.

Brush Mask: A 256x256 texture that masks the brush heightmap when painting to create brush shapes other than squares. The brush heightmap is a grayscale image that represents the height of the terrain at each point. When painting with the brush tool, the brush heightmap is modified to create the desired shape. The brush mask is used to further modify the brush heightmap by masking out certain areas. The brush heightmap will be faded out in proportion to the darkness of the overlapping mask pixels.

Height Multiplier: This feature multiplies the heights of the terrain when generating from scratch or from existing. When generating terrain, the height multiplier is used to adjust the height of the terrain. A higher value will result in taller terrain, while a lower value will result in shorter terrain.

UpSample Mode: The type of upsampling algorithm that will be used if UpSample Resolution is greater than 256. Upsampling is the process of increasing the resolution of an image or dataset. In this case, the upsampling algorithm is used to increase the resolution of the terrain when generating it. There are several different types of upsampling algorithms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

UpSample Resolution: The resolution of the terrain when generating from scratch or from existing. The resolution of the terrain determines how detailed it is. A higher resolution will result in more detailed terrain, while a lower resolution will result in less detailed terrain.

Blended Function Start Value: The value of the blending function (f(x) = mx + b) at x = 0. The blending function is used to blend the terrain with its neighbors. The start value of the blending function determines how much the terrain is blended with its neighbors at the start of the blending process.

Blend With Neighbors: This feature blends selected terrain with neighbors, ignoring current neighbor heights. When generating terrain, the terrain can be blended with its neighbors to create a more seamless transition between them. When this feature is enabled, the terrain is blended with its neighbors, ignoring the current height of the neighbors.
